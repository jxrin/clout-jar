Bet on your favorite basketball games against your favorite friends!

## What is Clout-Jar and why?

Clout-Jar is a web application where as a small group of friends you can bet on basketball games together to gain points. If you win your bet, you gain a number of points based on your bet. If you lose, the money you bet goes into the jar. The money in the jar can then be used to buy something together as a group or for the individual with the most points. 

My friends and I used to run something similar in our house during university so we wanted to make an online version that is more streamlined and organized!
